# Data-Structures
My implementation for different data structures (C++ classes)

## Graph algorithms:
* Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
* Bellmanâ€“Ford Algorithm for Shortest Paths
* Kosaraju's Algorithm for SCC
* Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
* Bfs, Dfs
* Maximum Bipartite Matching
* Topological Sorting

## Tree algorithms:
* Diameter of a tree

## Data structures:
* Min-Max Segment Tree
* Fenwick Tree
* Disjoint Set

## Dynamic Programming:
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Maximum Subarray Sum

## Geometry:
* Closest points in a plane

## Other:
* Range Minimum Query using Sparse Table
